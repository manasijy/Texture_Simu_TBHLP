# Texture_Simu_TBHLP
Original codes
This one is ready. It is working.
It is based on Taylor Bishop Hill approch. This code uses Linear Programming -a modified Simplex approach to solve 
the taylor equaitons. It has the capability to address perfect, partial, twinning systems. It will be updated to include 
relax constraint model also. That is also in progress in one of the other folders.
